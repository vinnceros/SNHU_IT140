# Write a program whose inputs are three integers, and whose output is the smallest of the three values.
# Ex. If the input is: 7  15  3
# The expected output should be 3.
# This reads the three integers that are input by the user.

first = int(input())
second = int(input())
third = int(input())

# Now calculate the smallest number of the three values.

smallest = first
if second < smallest:
    smallest = second
if third < smallest:
    smallest = third

# Print the smallest number.

print(smallest)
