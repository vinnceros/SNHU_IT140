# Given four values representing counts of quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies, output the total amount as dollars and cents.
# Output each floating point value with two digits after the decimal point, which can be achieved as follows:
# print(f'Amount: ${dollars:.2f}') Ex. If the input is: 4 3 2 1
# where 4 is the number of quarters, 3 is the number of dimes, 2 is the number of nickels, # and 1 is the number of pennies, 
# the output is: Amount:$1.41. 
# For simplicity, assume the input is a non-negative number.

quarters = int(input())
dimes = int(input())
nickels = int(input())
pennies = int(input())

Amount = quarters*0.25 + dimes*0.10 + nickels*0.05 + pennies*0.01
# Prints out Amount within two decimal places.
print('Amount: ${:.2f}'.format(Amount))
