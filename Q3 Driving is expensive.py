# Driving is expensive. Write a program with a car's miles/gallons and gas dollars/gallons(both doubles) as input,
# and output the gas cost for 20 miles, 75 miles, and 500 miles.
# 
# Output each floating-point value with two digits after the decimal point, which can be achieved as follows:
# print('{:.2f} {:.2f} {:.2f}' .format(dollars_20_miles, dollars_75_miles, dollars_500_miles))
# Ex. If the input is: 20.00  3.1599
# The output is: 3.16  11.85  79.00
# 
# Note: Real per-mile cost would also include maintenance and depreciation."""
