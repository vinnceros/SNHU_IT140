# zybooks 9.7 Clone of LAB Input and formatted output Caffeine levels
# A half-life is the amount of time it takes for a substance or entity to fall to half its original value. 
# Caffeine has a half-life of about 6 hours in humans. Given caffeine amount (in mg) as input, output the 
# caffeine level after 6, 12, and 24 hours. Use a string formatting expression with conversion specifiers 
# to output the caffeine amount as floating-point numbers.
# 
# Output each floating-point value with two digits after the decimal point, which can be achieved as follows:
# print('{:.2f}'.format(your_value))
# 
# Ex: If the input is:
# 
# 100
# the output is:
# 
# After 6 hours: 50.00 mg
# After 12 hours: 25.00 mg
# After 24 hours: 6.25 mg
# Note: A cup of coffee has about 100 mg. A soda has about 40 mg. An "energy" drink (a misnomer) has between 100 mg and 200 mg.
