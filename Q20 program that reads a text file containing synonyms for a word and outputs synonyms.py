# Write a program that reads a text file containing synonyms for a word and 
# outputs synonyms that bgin with a specified letter.
# Use the attached file educate.txt to help you write and test your program. 
# This file contains synonyms for the word "educate" listed in alphabetical order, 
# with each row containing synonyms sharing the same first letter, separated by a
# space. The contents of educate.txt are as follows:
# 
# educate.txt
# --------------
# brainwash brief
# civilize coach cultivate
# develop discipline drill
# edify enlighten exercise explain
# foster
# improve indoctinate inform instruct
# mature
# nurture
# rear
# school
# train tutor
# ---------------------------
# 
# Your program should read input from the user in the format of a word, a line break, and a letter.
# The program should open a text file associated with the input word.
# The program should then store the contents of the text file into a dictionary, predefined in the program,
# Finally the program should search the dictionary and outputs all the synonyms that begin with the input letter,
# one synonym per line, or a message if no synonyms that begin with the output letter are found.
# Hint: use the first letter of a synonym as the key when storing the synonym into the dictionary. Assume all
# letters are in lowercase.
# 
# For example, if the input of the program is:
# educate
# c
# the program opens the file educate.txt, then produces the following output:
# civilize
# coach
# cultivate

synonyms = {} 

# this is the dictionary to store synonyms

word = input() 

# user inputs word that contains the file name.

with open(word + ".txt", "r") as myFile:
    lines = myFile.readlines() 

# read each index as it stores the data of each line
    
for data in lines:
        data.strip()
        synonyms[data[0][0]] = data.split("")

myFile.close()

letter = input()
if letter not in synonyms.keys():
    print("No synonyms for", word, "begin with", letter + ".")
else:
    for ele in synonyms[letter]:
        print(ele)
