# Write a program to calculate the total price for car wash services. 
# A base car wash is $10. A dictionary with each additional service
# and the corresponding cost has been provided. Two additional services can be selected. 
# A '-' signifies an additional service was not selected. 
# Output all selected services along with the cooresponding costs and then the total price for all car wash services.
# Ex. If the input is:
# Tire shine
# Wax
# The output is:
# ZyCar Wash
# Base car wash -- $10
# Tire shine -- $2
# Wax -- $3
# Total price: $15
