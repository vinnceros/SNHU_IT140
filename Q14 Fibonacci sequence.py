# The Fibonacci sequence begins with 0 and 1,
# with all subsequent terms formed as the sum of the previous two values. 
# For example, the first terms of the Fibonacci sequence are 0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13...
# Complete the fibonacci() method, which has an index, n, as parameter and returns
# the nth term in the sequence. Any negative index values should return -1.
# Ex. If the input is: 7 The output is: fibonacci(7) is 13
# Note: Use a for loop abd DO NOT use recursion.
